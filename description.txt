As the name suggests Library Management System will deal in all the requirements needed for managing libraries. 
It will deal with the process of maintaining data about the books and many other things as well as transactions, 
which are taking place in the library with respect to the issue and return of the books.

This solution helps the 
administrator to accomplish his tasks at ease. This solution is an online library management system, which lets 
users sign-up to the library initially and then sign-in every time they want to find some item in the library. 
The user can also maintain and edit his profile details.

It also lets administrators manage the library from their 
desktop. They can monitor any item, its stock and other related information. A user can sign-in and search for 
items, borrow items if they are present in the library. All details of the user are stored in the database, 
which eases pressure on the administrator about defaulters. The administrator can block or remove the defaulters 
from the library. The user need not visit the library every time to find an item; instead, he/she can search 
items from his/her own PC/laptop. 

Reports can also be generated for individual items or for number of defaulters and the number of transactions for an item or by a user.
